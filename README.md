# Competitive Lotka-Volterra
The numerical simulation of a competitive N-species Lotka-Volterra model is performed with a Runge-Kutta 4.

The idea is to create an Agent Based Model which reflects the mean field behaviour of the exact solution with the addition of fluctuations caused by the spatial information.
